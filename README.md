# Abstract

**Objective**

We evaluated the temporal trend of the gender ratio of first and last authors in the oncological research field among major general medical and oncology journals and examine the gender pattern in coauthorship. 

**Design**

We conducted a retrospective study in PubMed using the R package RISmed. We retrieved original research articles from four general medical and six oncology specialty journals selected based on their impact factors and popularity among oncologists. We identified the names of first and last authors from Jan 1, 2002 to Dec 31, 2019. The authors’ genders were identified and validated using the Gender-API database (https://gender-api.com/). 
Primary and secondary outcome measures: the percentages of first and last authors by gender and the gender ratios (male/female) and the temporal trends in gender ratios of first and last authors were determined.

**Results**

We identified the gender of first and last authors for 32,452 research articles. The proportions of female first and last authors increased from 28% and 17% in 2002, respectively, to 36% and 30% in 2019, respectively. The first and last author gender ratios decreased by 1.5% and 2.6% per year, respectively (first author: incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97 to 1.00 and last author: IRR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96 to 0.99). Male first and last authorship was the most common combination. Male-male pairs significantly decreased by 2% over time (IRR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.98 to 0.99), whereas male-female and female-female pairs increased by 2.0% and 5.0%, respectively (IRR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.03 and IRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.06, respectively).

**Conclusions**

We observed an increase in female authors over the study period. However, the continued underrepresentation of women as first authors means that that more efforts to address parity for the advancement of women in academic oncology are needed.
